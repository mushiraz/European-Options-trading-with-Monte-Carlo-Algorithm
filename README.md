# European Options trading with Monte Carlo Algorithm
 Prices European options trading (Calls/Puts) by utilizing the Monte Carlo algorithm.


 # Background
* The Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm whose output may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability.

* An option is a contract giving the buyer the right—but not the obligation—to buy (in the case of a call) or sell (in the case of a put) the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date.

* By utilizing the monte carlo algorithm we are able to accuratly predict the price that a call/put contract might out as given a few market indicators. 

* `S` - within the context of options represents the underlying price of the asset
* `k` - represents the strike price of the option.
* `r` - risk free rate of the market.
* `v` - the volitility of the asset.
* `T` - maturity time for the asset.
